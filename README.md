# Odot C Series IO Rack Builder
This is a tool for building an Odot C Series IO Rack. It ensures that the correct modules are selected for the IO Rack.

## Purpose
- This is a personal project part of my back-end developer program through <boot.dev>.
- I wanted to create something that would be helpful for me and something very interesting to me so that in hopes that it would be easier to work on compared to a project chosen for me.
- I wanted to build a remote IO rack using Odot C Series IO and thought it would be helpful to have a web based tool for determining the correct modules to order. Odot does have a [configuration tool](https://www.odotautomation.com/downloads_catalog/io-user-manual-config-software/) that can be downloaded and installed.

## Resources
I didn't have much experience with Flask before this project so I worked through the following tutorials to help me get started.
